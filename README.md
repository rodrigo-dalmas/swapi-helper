# SWAPI - Another AngularJS service to get data from Swapi
For more info on the SWAPI API, go to www.swapi.co.

The service is promise oriented at most and get data from [swapi.co](http://swapi.co) for AngularJS applications.

The `swapi` service comes with one angular constant `endpoints`, used internally and exposed by the main service `swapi`.

To use the service just download the (https://github.azc.ext.hp.com/rodrigo-dalmas/swapi-helper/blob/master/dist/services/swapi.min.js) file and import the service in your AngularJS controller.

In your javascript:

```javascript
// include the service
angular.module('myApp', ['$scope']).

controller('jediController', ['swapi',
  function($scope, SwapiService) {

    // To get all people from the service:
    #Option 1 - using global method 'getData':
    SwapiService.getData('http://resource/to/people/api/').
        then(function(allPeople){
          $scope.everybody = allPeople;
        });

    #Option 2 - using specific method 'getAllPeople':
    SwapiService.getAllPeople().
        then(function(allPeople){
          $scope.everybody = allPeople;
        });
  }
])
```

Inside your view template:

```html
<ul ng-repeat="person in everybody">
  <li>Name: {{person.name}}</li>
  <li>Eyes color: {{person.eye_color}}</li>
  <li>Skin color: {{person.skin_color}}</li>
</ul>
```

For more information on how to use the service, please refer to the demo project (angular) to check out how it was fully implemented.

About the demo page:

### MWM Framework
* Angular (https://angularjs.org/)

`WHY?`
* Performance, organization, great echosystem, quick to develop.

### Front End
* It was used FlexBoxGrid (http://flexboxgrid.com/) and Bootstrap (for the top bar only - css) to build the front end.

`WHY?`
* Flexboxgrid provides a subset of classes that transform your page and add superb compatibility for each viewport.
* Bootstrap can be used, as well as flexboxgrid, to responsiveness and to get components ready. In this case, it was used to get the topbar, which has a great design by the way.

### Directory organization
The approach of the directory organization was to separate controllers, directives, templates and so on, to allow the project to grow up.

```javascript
- App
    -> controllers
    -> directives
    -> js
    -> partials
    -> templates
    -> src (images)
    -> test
```

### Task runner
* Gulp (http://gulpjs.com/)

`WHY?`
* Gulp is the best way to automate and generate minified files, sprites, css and put all of this in a dist folder. It helps A LOT!
